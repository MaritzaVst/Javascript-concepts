#Types
How javascript deal with types? 

There are some programming languages that you need to define what type each variable is, that is called static typed. Where compiler do the type checking process and will detect bugs early. Examples: Java, C, C++.

```C
	int a;
	bool mybool = 'noway'; // an error
```

In the other hand, exists languages that uses Dynamic Typing like  perl, javascript where type checking occurs when code is interpreted.

```javascript
	var bool = true;
	bool = 'hi'; // no errors
	bool = 123;
```
